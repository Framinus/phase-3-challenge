# Phase 3 Challenge

Welcome to my phase assessment repository!

## Part-1:

Run npm install to get the packages and scripts you need, and npm start to start the server.

## Part-2:

Run npm install to get the packages and scripts you need, and then follow the scripts in the package.json to initialize your database, load the schema and load the data. If you wish to test the program first, use the db:test scripts instead.
